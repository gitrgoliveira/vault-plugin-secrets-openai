# Project Status

## Completed Tasks
1. Implemented proper random string generation for service account names
   - Added secure random generation using `crypto/rand`
   - Implemented character set filtering for valid identifiers

2. Added proper template formatting for service account names
   - Used Go's text/template package for flexible name formatting
   - Added support for multiple template variables (RoleName, RandomSuffix, ProjectName)

3. Added unit tests for critical components
   - Client tests for configuration and API operations
   - Dynamic credentials functionality tests
   - Configuration path tests

4. Enhanced documentation
   - Added detailed configuration options for roles
   - Expanded usage instructions with examples
   - Added development workflow documentation
   - Added testing instructions

5. Fixed test failures
   - Added proper test environment setup for client in tests
   - Fixed validation logic in pathRoleWrite validation tests
   - Updated test assertions to correctly validate logical.Response error information

6. Added comprehensive error handling in the client and credential creation logic
   - Enhanced error reporting to include all available error data
   - Added proper validation of inputs in all client methods
   - Implemented extensive logging with debug, info, and error levels
   - Added context information in error messages for easier debugging

7. Implemented a mock OpenAI API server for integration testing
   - Created a complete mock server with support for all API operations
   - Added the ability to simulate failures for testing error handling
   - Implemented comprehensive integration tests covering full workflows

8. Added a cleanup routine for orphaned service accounts
   - Created a CleanupManager that runs periodically to check for orphaned accounts
   - Implemented integration with Vault's lease system
   - Added cleanup for expired API keys and service accounts

9. Implemented proper validation for service account names
   - Added comprehensive validation based on OpenAI requirements
   - Implemented name sanitization to ensure names meet requirements
   - Added extensive test cases for validation

10. Implemented Prometheus-compatible monitoring and metrics for credential usage
    - Metrics for issuance, revocation, API errors, and quota usage
    - Integrated with Vault telemetry and Prometheus conventions
    - Added tests and documentation for metrics

11. Implemented root config/admin key rotation
    - Added manual and scheduled admin API key rotation logic
    - Exposed rotation endpoint and integrated with backend initialization
    - Added unit tests for manual and scheduled rotation
    - Aligned with HashiCorp plugin best practices (see vault-plugin-secrets-gcp)

12. Implemented check-in/check-out mechanism for service accounts
    - Created library sets for managing groups of service accounts
    - Added service account checkout with API key generation
    - Implemented service account checkin with API key rotation
    - Added status tracking for checkout availability
    - Created admin (forced) checkin operations
    - Added comprehensive tests for all checkout operations
    - Integrated with metrics system for checkout monitoring
    - Added proper security checks for checkin authorization
    - Hardened error handling for all edge cases and nil pointer scenarios
    - All unit and integration tests pass; logic is robust and compliant

13. Dockerfile updated to use Go 1.24.3, resolving Go version mismatch issues
14. Docker image builds successfully, including all dependencies and the `make build` step

## Completed Tasks (continued)
15. Repository restructured to follow HashiCorp's standard plugin structure pattern
16. Renamed Go package from "openai" to "openaisecrets" for better distinction
17. Consolidated and updated README files with comprehensive documentation
18. Fixed integration test script for containerized plugin testing

## Remaining Tasks
1. Add performance optimizations for large-scale deployments
2. Conduct further end-to-end testing in production-like environments
3. Gather feedback from community on plugin usability

## Next Steps
1. Expand and harden test coverage (integration, edge cases)
2. Optimize performance for large-scale deployments
3. Create interactive guide/tutorial for first-time users
4. Add support for OpenAI API versioning
5. Prepare for release and community feedback
